<h2><font color="black" size="4" face="timesnewroman"><b>During pregnancy, some women develop high blood sugar levels. This condition is known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or gestational diabetes.
Gestational diabetes typically develops between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it’s estimated to occur in 2 to 10 percent of pregnancies in the United States.

If you develop gestational diabetes while you’re pregnant, it doesn’t mean that you had diabetes before your pregnancy or will have it afterward. But
gestational diabetes does raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future.

If poorly managed, it can also raise your child’s risk of developing diabetes and increase the risk of complications for you and your baby during 
pregnancy and delivery.
