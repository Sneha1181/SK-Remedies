Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease. In people with type 1 diabetes, cells in the pancreas that make insulin are destroyed, and the body is unable to make insulin.

Insulin is a hormone that helps your body’s cells use glucose for energy. Your body gets glucose from the food you eat.Insulin allows the glucose to pass from your blood intoyour body’s cells.

When the cells have enough, your liver and muscle tissues store the extra glucose, also called blood sugar, in the form of glycogen.It’s broken down into blood sugar and released when you need energy between meals, during exercise, or while you sleep.

In type 1 diabetes, the body is unable to process glucose, due to the lack of insulin. Glucose from your food can’t make its way into the cells.This leaves too much glucose 
circulating in your blood. High blood sugar levels can lead to both short-term and long-term problems.
