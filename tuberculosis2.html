Some people with TB also believe that more expensive foods are better than less expensive ones. <br><br> For example, it is not true that costlier varieties of rice are better than cheaper ones.<br><br>

It is often better that a person with TB has the same diet as normal but possibly with some changes being made to increase their intake of food.<br> <br>People with TB often have a poor appetite initially, but having more frequent food intake can be helpful.<br>

Within a few weeks of starting TB treatment, the person’s appetite should increase and come back to normal.<br><br> A person with TB should aim to have three meals and three snacks each day to increase the amount of food they eat.</font></p>
